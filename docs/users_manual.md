# Supported LoRaWAN stacks/technologies

## The Things Network (TTN)

1.  Register your LoRaWAN gateways following `https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/registration.html`.
2.  Create one or several applications following `https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/add.html`.
3.  Register your LoRaWAN devices within your applications following
    `https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/devices/registration.html`.
4.  In order to use FIWARE IoT Agent for LoRaWAN protocol, you will need the following information:

-   Application ID (step 2)
-   Application key (step 2)
-   Device EUI (step 3)
-   App EUI (step 3)
-   Application server information
    -   Host (step 3)
    -   Username: It is the Application ID.
    -   Password (step 3)

## LoRaServer.io

1.  Install/deploy LoRa Server project. Docker installation method is recommended:
    `https://www.loraserver.io/install/docker/`
2.  Follow the [Getting started](https://www.loraserver.io/use/getting-started/) page to register your network-server
    and to create a service-profile, gateway, device-profile, application. Finally, add your LoRaWAN devices. Register
    your network-server: `https://www.loraserver.io/lora-app-server/use/network-servers/`
3.  In order to use FIWARE IoT Agent for LoRaWAN protocol, you will need the following information:

-   Application ID
-   Application key
-   Device EUI
-   App EUI
-   Application server information
    -   Host where MQTT broker is running.
    -   Username if it is defined.
    -   Password if it is defined.

# API Walkthrough

This section of the _Users Manual_ provides examples of how to use the IoTA API to provision LoRaWAN devices using three
different mechanisms.

All of them use a relatively simple device or node reporting the following measurements or observations:

-   The barometric pressure
-   The relative humidity
-   The temperature
-   A generic digital input
-   A generic digital output

## Device provisioning

This option allows provisioning a specific device, describing its attributes and LoRaWAN information. **Thus, using a
single Application Server, we can provision devices reporting different types of measurements.**

```bash
curl localhost:4061/iot/devices -s -S --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' --header 'fiware-service: smartgondor' --header 'fiware-servicepath: /gardens' -d @- <<EOF

  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "lora_n_003",

          "object_id": "bp0",
          "name": "barometric_pressure_0",
          "type": "hpa"
        },
        {
          "object_id": "di3",
          "name": "digital_in_3",
          "type": "Number"
        },

          "type": "Number"
        },
        {
          "object_id": "rh2",
          "name": "relative_humidity_2",
          "type": "Number"
        },
        {
          "object_id": "t1",
          "name": "temperature_1",
          "type": "Number"
        }
      ],
      "internal_attributes": {
        "lorawan": {
          "application_server": {
            "host": "eu.thethings.network",",
            "username": "ari_ioe_app_demo1",
            "password": "pwd1",
            "provider": "TTN"
          },
          "dev_eui": "1119343755556A14",
          "app_eui": "4569343567897875",
          "application_id": "ari_ioe_app_demo1",
          "application_key": "444B8EF16415B5F6ED777EAFE695C49",
          "data_model": "cayennelpp"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

-   provider: Identifies the LoRaWAN stack. **Current possible value is TTN.**
-   data_model: Identifies the data model used by the device to report new observations. **Current possible values are
    cayennelpp,cbor and application_server. The last one can be used in case the payload format decoding is done by the
    application server.**

The IoTa will automatically subscribe to new observation notifications from the device. Whenever a new update is
received, it will be translated to NGSI and forwarded to the Orion Context Broker.

You can query the corresponding entity in the Context Broker with:

```bash
curl localhost:1026/v2/entities/LORA-N-003 -s -S -H 'Accept: application/json' --header 'fiware-service: smartgondor' --header 'fiware-servicepath: /gardens' | python -mjson.tool
```

## Configuration provisioning

If a group of devices reports the same observations (i.e., smart meters for a neighborhood or building), the
_configuration API_ can be used to pre-provision all of them with a single request.**With this approach, all the devices
sharing the same configuration must be registered under the same Application Server.**

```bash
curl localhost:4061/iot/services -s -S --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' --header 'fiware-service: smartgondor' --header 'fiware-servicepath: /gardens' -d @- <<EOF
{
	"services": [
   {
    "entity_type": "LoraDeviceGroup",
    "apikey": "",
    "resource": "4569343567897875",
    "attributes": [
      {
        "object_id": "bp0",
        "name": "barometric_pressure_0",
        "type": "Number"
      },
      {
        "object_id": "di3",
        "name": "digital_in_3",
        "type": "Number"
      },
      {
        "object_id": "do4",
        "name": "digital_out_4",
        "type": "Number"
      },
      {
        "object_id": "rh2",
        "name": "relative_humidity_2",
        "type": "Number"
      },
      {
        "object_id": "t1",
        "name": "temperature_1",
        "type": "Number"
      }
    ],
    "internal_attributes": {
        "lorawan": {
          "application_server": {
            "host": "eu.thethings.network",",
            "username": "ari_ioe_app_demo1",
            "password": "pwd1",
            "provider": "TTN"
          },
          "app_eui": "4569343567897875",
          "application_id": "ari_ioe_app_demo1",
          "application_key": "444B8EF16415B5F6ED777EAFE695C49",
          "data_model": "cayennelpp"
    }
  }
]
}
EOF
```

As it can be seen, the **resource** property of the payload must match the App EUI.

In this case, the IoTA will subscribe to any observation coming from the LoRaWAN application server. Whenever a new
update arrives, it will create the corresponding device internally and also in the Context Broker using the
pre-provisioned configuration. Finally, it will forward appropriate context update requests to the Context Broker to
update the attributes' values.

## Static configuration

Finally, it is also possible to provide a static configuration for the IoTa. As it happens with the previous
alternative, this approach is useful for groups of devices which report the same observations. Again, **all the devices
sharing the same _Type_ must be registered under the same Application Server.**

```javascript
var config = {};

config.iota = {

    logLevel: "DEBUG",
    contextBroker: {

                {
                    object_id: "bp0",
                    name: "barometric_pressure_0",
                    type: "hpa"
                },
                {
                    object_id: "di3",
                    name: "digital_in_3",
                    type: "Number"
                },
                {
                    object_id: "do4",
                    name: "digital_out_4",
                    type: "Number"
                },
                {
                    object_id: "rh2",
                    name: "relative_humidity_2",
                    type: "Number"
                },
                {
                    object_id: "t1",
                    name: "temperature_1",
                    type: "Number"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
};

module.exports = config;
```
