The Internet of Things Agent for LoRaWAN protocol enables data and commands to
be exchanged between IoT devices and the
[NGSI](https://swagger.lab.fiware.org/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiware/specifications/master/OpenAPI/ngsiv2/ngsiv2-openapi.json)
interface of a context broker using the
[LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) protocol.

It is based on the
[IoT Agent Node.js Library](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib).
Further general information about the FIWARE IoT Agents framework, its
architecture and the common interaction model can be found in the library's
GitHub repository.
