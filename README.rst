FIWARE IoT Agent for LoRaWAN protocol
=====================================

|License badge| |Docker badge| |Support badge| |Build Status|

FIWARE *Internet of Things* Agent for LoRaWAN protocol enables data and
commands to be exchanged between IoT devices and `FIWARE NGSI Context
Brokers <https://forge.fiware.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/FIWARE.OpenSpecification.Data.ContextBroker>`__
using `LoRaWAN <https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan>`__ protocol.

It is based on the `FIWARE IoT Agent Node.js
Library <https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib>`__. Further
general information about FIWARE IoT Agents framework, its architecture
and interaction model can be found in this repository.

This project is part of `FIWARE <https://www.fiware.org/>`__. Check also
the FIWARE Catalogue entry for the
`IoTAgents <https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/backend-device-management-idas>`__.

Description
-----------

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

As it is explained in `What is
LoRaWANâ„¢ <https://lora-alliance.org/sites/default/files/2018-04/what-is-lorawan.pdf>`__,
the proposed *Network Architecture* for a LoRaWAN based system relies on
a mesh network architecture composed of *End nodes*, *Concentrators*,
*Network Servers* and *Application Servers*. This IoTA is fully
compliant with this architecture, providing interoperability between
FIWARE NGSI Context Brokers and LoRaWAN devices.

Installation
------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`__
-  `MongoDB <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/>`__
-  `FIWARE Orion Context
   Broker <https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion>`__

Cloning the Github repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Clone the repository with the following command:

   ::

       https://github.com/Atos-Research-and-Innovation/IoTagent-LoRaWAN.git

2. Once the repository is cloned, from the root folder of the project
   execute:

   ::

       npm install

   This will download the dependencies for the project, and let it ready
   to the execution.

3. Launch the IoT Agent with the default configuration

   ::

       node bin/iotagent-lora

   You can use a custom configuration file:

   ::

    node bin/iotagent-lora custom_config.js

   The bootstrap process should finish with:

   ::

    info: Loading devices from registry
    info: LoRaWAN IoT Agent started

4. Check that the IoTA is running correctly:

   ::

    curl -v http://localhost:4061/iot/about

   The result must be similar to:

   ::

    {"libVersion":"2.6.0-next","port":4061,"baseRoot":"/"}

Using Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ready to use Docker image is
`provided <https://hub.docker.com/r/ioeari/iotagent-lora/>`__

::

    docker run -p 4061:4061 ioeari/iotagent-lora

Using Docker-compose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project contains an example to deploy the IoTA and all the
requirement using docker-compose.

::

    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
